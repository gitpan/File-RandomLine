TODO list for Perl module File::RandomLine

- Add an option on import that changes the heuristic from "fast" to "uniform".
    - Would need to change from scalar ref to hash ref to read and store the
      file's line index on object creation
    - Create subs "_fast" and "_uniform" and map "next()" to the right one
      on import
