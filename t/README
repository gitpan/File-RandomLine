TEST FILES README

File::RandomLine test files and data:

File_RandomLine.t   -- main test script
testdata.txt        -- sample data file with 4 lines
not_readable.txt    -- empty file used for testing unreadable file failure

Two additional files are present -- these were alternate test scripts
used in writing an article about Test::MockRandom.  They are redundant with
File_RandomLine.t, but are included here for reference and because I was
testing to make sure they worked as promised.  Their extensions are 
changed to avoid being picked up by the standard "Build test" cycle.

minimal_test.pt     -- stub test with only 2 cases
longer_test.pt      -- tests single lines only, no error checking
